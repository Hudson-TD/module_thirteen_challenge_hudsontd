# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End
  
## Description

The goal of this challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. We took an existing/functional Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This was accomplished via the use of several npm packages including (Sequelize, MySQL2, Express, Dotenv).

## Installation

1.) Clone repository:

https://github.com/Hudson-TD/module_thirteen_challenge_hudsontd

2.) Install dependencies

- Run npm init --y
- Run npm install (Sequelize, MySQL2, Express, Dotenv)

Preferable to the above approach the package-lock.json file will be cloned so you can simply run 'npm install' in the command line to download all required packages.

3.) MySQL Setup

- Open up MySQL shell and input login credentials
- Source the schema file

4.) Seeding

- Run 'npm run seed' or 'node seeds/index.js' from the command line to seed data

5.) Start server

- Run node server.js from the command line

## Usage

Once all of the installation steps are taken care of you can proceed to interact with the API via Insomnia or any other API design/testing platform.
